! remap caps lock to left control
remove Lock = Caps_Lock
keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
add Control = Control_L
! xcape is used later to map a tap of control to a press of escape
! in the meantime the actual escape key is better used for something else so:
!  - remap escape to grave accent (for 60% keyboard compatibility)
!  - remap print screen to escape (since it needs to be bound somewhere)
keysym Escape = grave asciitilde
keysym Print = Escape
